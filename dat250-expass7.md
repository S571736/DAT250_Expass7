# DAT250 expass 7

by Sondre Lindaas Gjesdal

## Thoughts

Personally i feel like the tutorial was a bit worse than the previous tutorials from the expasses. I feel like I had to focus more on what was where than getting a confident overview of the library.

## Technical problems

I had issues running the project with powershell as the shell does not recognise the rabbitmq package. After some troubleshooting I got the project to work, by making it into a maven project.

## Pending issues

There should not be any pending issues.
